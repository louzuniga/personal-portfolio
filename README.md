# Lourexel's Personal Portfolio

> Thanks in advance for checking out my personal portfolio! My ongoing journey to be a software developer has been one of the most challenging endeavor of my life so far. I must admit that I completely jumped in head first and was hoping that the water was deep enough for me to recover from all of the mistakes, struggles and challenges that is inevitably ahead. Needless to say, eight months later Iâ€™m still here and more curious and passionate about software development.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or if you just simply want to know how to pronounce my name :bowtie: Cheers!
